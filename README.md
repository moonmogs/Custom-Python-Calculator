# Custom-Python-Calculator
S M Chow Worn

I designed this calculator with younger children in mind. I removed the division, multiplication 
and decimal buttons since young children focus on simple operations when first learning about maths.

The background is a cool shade of light blue to not take attention from the calculator and instead add a nice  touch of colour.
I changed the operation buttons (+, -, =) to a light grey to add a bit of variety and make them easier to see on the display.
Again I used a cooler colour to keep it simple and add a bit of variety to the display.
