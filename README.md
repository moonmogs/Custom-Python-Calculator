### About My Project

I designed this calculator with younger children in mind. I removed the division, multiplication 
and decimal buttons since young children focus on simple operations when first learning about maths.

### The Design

The background is a cool shade of light blue to not take attention from the calculator and instead add a nice  touch of colour.
I changed the operation buttons (+, -, =) to a light grey to add a bit of variety and make them easier to see on the display.
Again I used a cooler colour to keep it simple and add a bit of variety to the display.

### The Layout

As I stated earlier I removed more complicated operations such as division and multiplication. While thinking of what I wanted to change about the standard calculator design I drew a sketch as shown below.
